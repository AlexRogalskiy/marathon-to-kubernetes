# Marathon to Kubernetes

A small application that converts `marathon.json` contracts (used by [Marathon](https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon)) to `deployment.yml` files (used by [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).  
Support is quite minimal and was primarily tailored for our internal use at [Insee](https://insee.fr/) but you may find it handy for your usage. Feel free to contribute, issues & pull requests are welcome !

## Usage

Packaging is still a work in progress.  
At the moment the only way to run the app is to to run it from source (either by writing more tests or by creating a main function) but we intend to support the following usages :

- Java CLI (something like `java -jar jeanmichel.jar marathon.json`)
- Docker run (something like `cat marathon.json | docker run -i image)
- Java library that you can include within your app
- Maybe a simple webapp UI
